/**
 * Scene carousel registration.
 *
 * The factory half of `DisplayManager.BuildDisplay()`: it named each scene and
 * pushed it onto the carousel in a fixed order. Order here matches upstream —
 * Video, Map, Camera, Gallery, Draw, Trivia, Feedback, Directory — with Idle
 * held separately, exactly as `DisplayManager` kept it outside `sceneList`.
 *
 * Upstream wrapped each scene's construction in its own try/catch so one bad
 * screen could not take down the kiosk. Construction is free here, so that
 * protection moved to render time in `SceneErrorBoundary`.
